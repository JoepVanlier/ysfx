**Check latest release**
Please verify that the bug still exists on the latest (pre-)release.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the bug or behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error / crash / blank UI.

If you have a minimal project file which depends on no other plugins than YSFX and reproduces the problem consider attaching it.

**Expected behavior**
A description of what you expected to happen and what happened instead. Please be as descriptive as possible.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots or videos to explain your problem. Especially if the UI is behaving weird, a screenshot can be quite helpful.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. iOS, Windows 10, Linux Ubunu]
 - DAW (including the version)
 - YSFX version, please only report bugs for (pre)-releases

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here. For example, include the JSFX that you used to produce the issue.

Note that it is worthwhile to test a few other JSFX, to check whether it is a specific issue with compatibility of one JSFX, or a more general issue with the metaplugin.
